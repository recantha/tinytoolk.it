I was somewhere without tools and needed to solder, so ordered some bits next day and used that as an excuse to make a mini soldering kit.

## Case

*  [Excellent Elite Spanker IFAK Outdoor Tactical Accessories Bag](http://www.excellentelitespanker.com/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=84&Id=454&FId=t3:84:3) Apparently the keyword I needed for a case this size was IFAK (Individual First Aid Kit). I bought this one purely because of the brand name.

The internal mesh pocket has a really odd velcro strap that can only attach by going through a hole left by not zipping it all up fully, which is really odd, so I don't use it.
