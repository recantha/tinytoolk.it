I was somewhere without tools and needed to solder, so ordered some bits next day and used that as an excuse to make a mini soldering kit.

The few Amazon links are affiliate links. Because I may as well reduce their profit margin by a tiny percentage.

## Case

Apparently the keyword I needed for a case this size was IFAK (Individual First Aid Kit). I bought this one purely because of the brand name.

* Excellent Elite Spanker Tactical Nylon IFAK Pouch ([Amazon affiliate link](https://amzn.to/4ldnMFF))

The internal mesh pocket has a really odd velcro strap that can only attach by going through a hole left by not zipping it all up fully, which is really odd, so I don't use it.
